What Is Good Content
Content we accept is educational, actionable, inclusive, based on real experience and is stage-appropriate to Heavybit's Seed to Series B developer company founder audience. 

Distribution
All contributed content will be shared widely to the Heavybit community through social channels, our newsletters, our Slack teams, and as direct reference materials to our members and prospective members.

Upon submission of your final draft, Heavybit will schedule the post for publishing and provide at least 5 days of lead time to you and your teams to help coordinate any shared promotions. We encourage you to share your posts to your own networks.

Republishing
Content can be republished on your company or personal site two weeks after being live on our site, but you must use a canonical link pointing back to the piece on the Heavybit site.

Contribution Deliverables
Length
We like to have posts that range from 500 to 2,000 words.
Longer blog posts provide space for more information, more examples, and more depth that will bring visitors back to our site again and again.
Longer, in-depth posts are also more likely to be picked up by larger media outlets and supernode sites like Reddit or Hacker News.
Citations, Links, and Relationships
Where applicable, add links to your post that point to existing Heavybit content relevant to your piece.
Use external links for any third-party perspectives, evidence, and statistics.
Disclose the nature of any relationship with a company or person that is mentioned in your content. This is most important if you’re mentioning your own product or service.
We reserve the right to add rel=”nofollow” to any link or remove a link attached to words or images before or after publication.
Do not link to any questionable sources or industries, such as pharmaceuticals, casinos, payday loans, or pornography.
Buying, selling, or trading links that appear in posts is strictly prohibited.
Formatting
Write out numbers from 1, 2, 3, etc.
Write percentages as digits.
Use one space after all punctuation.
Use the Oxford comma format.
Headers in H2 tags and sub-headers in H3 and H4 tags.
No span or div tags
